# GrandReinforcementLearning
A repository for the GTA 5 part of the reinforcement mod.

It uses tcp communication on port 3223 and transmits two pictures, a 3d person and a 1st person.
Look into the TCPManager.h and TCPManager.cpp inorder to find the communication structure.

Many thanks to ikt over at Manual Transmission for the memory patching and advice, go check it out.
